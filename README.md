The project aimed at comparing two Machine models, Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) and Linear Regression model(OLS)  
Steps followed to achieve results:
  - In this Project we extract closing prices data of a particular stock from Yahoo Finance APIs using Python.  
  - Cleaned the data and before fitting it into the model.
  - Used Data Visualization Grapgh show historical perfomance of stocks.
  - I used the data to train/test the two models on a 70/30 percent data splits for both LSTM and Linear Regression Models.
  - The result for both models were impressive in predicting the stock price and the trends the stocks follows.
  - The linear Regression Model achieved superior results of more than 90% to beat LSTM model.
